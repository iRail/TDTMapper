# Pieter Colpaert's collected PHP tools

This is a folder which I use to bootstrap my projects in combination with the HTML5 boilerplate you can find at http://html5boilerplate.com/.

It is a simple micro framework which adds some missing things to PHP 5.3: decent caching, simple 1 line data fetcher, a router (glue), error logging...

# How to use

This is a basic LAMP thing. (Linux, apache, mysql, php 5.3)

You can plugin your own cache, get file contents, and so on.

# Getting started

The Router does all the magic. Include your regex and map it to a class name. Include that class and implement the functions you need:
public function GET($matches){
    $matches; //matches your regex
}
